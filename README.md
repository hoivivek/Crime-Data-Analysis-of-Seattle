This project focuses on the analysis of crime patterns in Seattle, integrating socio-economic data to explore potential links between crime rates and economic disparities. Using detailed data from the Seattle Police Department (SPD) between the years 2008-2024, along with poverty statistics and geographic data at the census block and community reporting area levels, the study provides a holistic perspective on the intersection of crime and socio-economic factors.
